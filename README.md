# Math-Curriculum

I'm self-studying math, and although I've seen some spurious posts online about what classes to take and in what order, including

- [learn math from start to finish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTnEG_WGd2Q)
- [What is the standard undergraduate math curriculum?](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/67pmky/what_is_the_standard_undergraduate_math_curriculum/)
- Various college sites explaining undergrad math requirements

I haven't seen a written form that lists out the relevant classes with recommendations on textbooks to use. I'm self-studying math from undergrad to some graduate levels, so I'll be using this as a tracker for myself anyway.

## Elementary

This category constitutes anything before college. I highly recommend the [AoPS Curriculum](https://artofproblemsolving.com/store) for pretty much every subject here, since they are gentle yet comprehensive ways to learn each of these subjects. They are also great for competition math, and are written in a way that motivates kids and are fun and friendly to read.

- Discrete Math
- Number Sense: Math tricks, good for making arithmetic and computation easier throughout learning
- Number Theory
  - [Introduction to Number Theory by AoPS](https://artofproblemsolving.com/store/book/intro-number-theory)
- Combinatorics/Probability
  - [Introduction to Counting & Probability by AoPS](https://artofproblemsolving.com/store/book/intro-counting): Amazing book, especially for competition math. This is readable in the latter half of elementary school and middle school.
  - [Intermediate Counting & Probability by AoPS](https://artofproblemsolving.com/store/book/intermediate-counting): Still a great book, readable from middle school to high school.
- Geometry
  - [Geometry by AoPS](https://artofproblemsolving.com/store/book/intro-geometry) 
- Prealgebra: Some schools allow students who excel to skip this class
  - [Prealgebra by AoPS](https://artofproblemsolving.com/store/book/prealgebra)
- Algebra I/II
  - [Introduction to Algebra by AoPS](https://artofproblemsolving.com/store/book/intro-algebra)
  - [Intermediate Algebra by AoPS](https://artofproblemsolving.com/store/book/intermediate-algebra)
- Precalculus
  - [Precalculus by AoPS](https://artofproblemsolving.com/store/book/precalculus)
- Statistics
  - [Statistics by David Freeman](https://amzn.to/3LPkXKc): A very gentle, equation-free book about stats and why it is important. The intuition developed by this book is paramount before attempting any real statistics.

## Undergraduate

- Calculus
  - [Calculus by AoPS](https://artofproblemsolving.com/store/book/calculus): This is probably a better contest prep book, e.g. for Putnam, but there are some cool intuitive instructions in this book.
- Linear Algebra
- Multivariate Calculus
- Complex Analysis
- Ordinary Differential Equations
- Probability Theory
- Real Analysis
  - Introduction: [Understanding Analysis (Abbott)](https://amzn.to/3wXODiO)
  - Advanced: [Principles of Mathematical Analysis aka Baby Rudin](https://amzn.to/38XdOsD)
- Abstract Algebra
- Topology
  - [Topology by Munkres](https://amzn.to/3xoBdLV).

## Graduate

- Real Analysis (Measure Theory):
  - Papa Rudin
- Topology
